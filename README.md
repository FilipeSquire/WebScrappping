# WebScrappping

This is a repository dedicated solely for building web scrapping codes. 

All of the files started as an initial necessity to go through hundreds of offers on these platforms, so that I could filter all of them using my own criterias based on statistics and the real state metrics mined from the scrapping dataset.

## Future Idea
* `Real State AI` -> It would be interesting to have a chatbot that could help me providing information regarding real state, being these information either taken through webscrapping at these renting platforms or also from other websites such as government and real state funds. The purpose of this chatbot would be to work with a GenAI underneath which has been trained with a rich real state data. My main intentions of how to use it would be to look for apartments to rent and to understand real state news in general.
